## Description of the game 

Hangman: Countries Edition is a challenging text-based guessing game where players need to correctly identify the name of a country. The game begins with a random country's name hidden by a series of underscores, representing the letters in the word. Players must guess one letter at a time, and if the letter is in the country's name, it is revealed in its correct position(s). However, incorrect guesses result in strikes. Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the country before the hangman is fully revealed, leading to a loss. Hints are available but come with penalties, so players must strategize to achieve the highest score by guessing the country with the fewest incorrect attempts and hints. It's a fun and engaging way to test your knowledge of countries while challenging yourself to win the game!


## Features of the game 

1. Clue-Based Questions: Players can ask yes or no questions to gather clues about the country they are trying to guess. The game responds with simple "yes" or "no" answers, providing guidance to help players narrow down their guesses.
2. Game State Saving: The use of linked lists allows players to save the game's state at any point. This feature enables players to pause the game and resume from where they left off later, without losing progress. ** nanti tambah lagi
