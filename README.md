## Description of the game 

The text-based game is an interactive game where players test their knowledge by attempting to guess the name of a country based on a series of clues and questions. The game starts by presenting the player with a random country. The player's task is to guess the name of that country by asking yes or no questions. The game responds to the player's questions with a simple "yes" or "no" answer, providing guidance to help narrow down the possibilities. The player can then use the information obtained to make an informed guess or ask additional questions to gather more details. To add an element of challenge and excitement, the game can keep track of the number of questions asked by the player and award points based on the accuracy and efficiency of their guesses. This encourages players to think strategically and make intelligent deductions to optimize their score. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the country or decides to give up. Upon a correct guess, the game congratulates the player and may provide interesting facts or trivia about the country. If the player gives up, the game reveals the correct answer and offers the opportunity to play again. Furthermore, to enable the game to remember the player's progress, a linked list data structure can be utilized. This allows players to save their game state, including the current country being guessed and any questions asked, so they can resume their progress at a later time. Overall, the text-based quiz game of guessing the country offers an engaging and educational experience, testing players' knowledge of geography while challenging their deduction and reasoning skills.
